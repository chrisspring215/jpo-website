          <p>JP was convicted in 2007 for the stabbing death of Daniel Vincent Sorenson. Almost immediately, the case was irresponsibly labeled a “Thrill Kill” by the Prosecutor’s Office and the media ran away with that as its headline. Little to no foundational information or details concerning the background of the case were allowed at trial. Thus, the information that has been published about the case is, at best, incomplete.</p>

          <p>A cursory review of the published media reports make it obvious that large chunks of information are lacking from the overall story. This has left many people, including those close to JP, questioning the outcome of the case. The information missing from the story is critical to comprehending what happened. Such information principally consists of the years-long relationship between JP Orlewicz and Mr. Sorenson, and the nature of the specific events that led up to Mr. Sorenson’s death.</p>

          <p>By understanding the complete story, it is as clear as day that Soreson’s death was not the result of a “Thrill Kill,” as the prosecutor rashly conjectured, but rather the undoing of a grown man with a violent demeanor who manipulated and intimidated teenagers through death threats and armed extortion. The events leading up to Sorenson’s death were characteristic of and consistent with his established pattern of predatory behavior toward vulnerable individuals. It is only with this context that the events of Sorenson’s death can be reasonably understood and interpreted.</p>
