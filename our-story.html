          <h1>Our Story</h1>

          <p>The events leading to the death of Daniel Sorenson and the incarceration of Jean Pierre “JP” Orlewicz were tragic for the all of the families involved. There is no question that everyone has been irreparably affected by what occurred on November 7, 2007. However, many friends, relatives, neighbors and others have been left with unanswered questions concerning how and why something so baffling could happen. Until now, only one version of the story has been publicly told.</p>

          <p>Just days after JP's arrest, the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office held a media press conference, at which the prosecutor summarily described Mr. Sorenson's death the result of a “Thrill Kill.” The prosecutor's extrajudicial statement was not supported by any evidence, but it effectively set off a media frenzy, resulting in widespread reporting of a highly skewed and uninformed version of the case. Since then, that uninformed version has been ubiquitous in the media and public eye. The purpose of this site is to shed light on the actual events that took place preceding Mr. Sorenson's death and JP Orlewicz's arrest in connection with it.

          <p>In the late spring of 2006, Jean Pierre “JP” Orlewicz had just turned 16 years old. He was a sophomore at Canton High School. At this same time, Daniel Sorenson was 25 years old, approximately nine years older than JP. However, at the time JP was introduced to Daniel Sorenson by a high school friend, Sorenson was purporting himself to be only 19, presumably to conceal the oddity of a man his age hanging around with teenaged boys.

          <p>Mr. Sorenson had no familial connection to JP or any of JP's friends, but had somehow managed to cultivate a relationship them, as well as with a number of other high school boys in the local area. Sorenson referred to these boys as his “little cousins,” and would later use his relationship with them as an opportunity to manipulate and intimidate them for personal gain.</p>

          <p>Around this same time period in 2006, Sorenson had stopped reporting his whereabouts to police in violation of his probation as a sex offender. (He had been convicted in 2000 for having a sexual relationship with a minor). In unrelated cases, Sorenson had also become the subject of three police complaints made against him for behavior ranging from manipulation and intimidation to death threats to violent outbursts and stalking. Two of the complaints resulted in court-ordered Personal Protection Orders (PPOs) issued against Sorenson.</p>

          <p>The testimony of Sorenson's PPO complainants includes statements like:</p>

          <blockquote>“Daniel called and said he was going to kill her and her son… He will get her son at school while she is walking the dog.”<cite>Plymouth Township Police Department, Case No. 0790000113</cite></blockquote>

          <blockquote>”Every girl that’s ever rejected him, he adds them to a hit list and describes at how -- he’s got a big, giant list of all these women, describing how he’s going to kill them -- and rape them… He’s totally out of his mind.”<cite>Personal Protection Order 07-712818</cite></blockquote>

          <blockquote>“He told me that I knew better than to threaten him with the cops- that he would snap my neck if I went to the cops… He said that now I was going to die.”<cite>Personal Protection Order 02-222182</cite></blockquote>

          <p>These records alone establish a very menacing and aggressive pattern of behavior, and shed some insight into Sorenson’s nature. If this type of behavior was capable of making even grown adults fearful of Sorenson, what effect might they have a on a minor?</p>

          <p>Over the next several months, Sorenson became persistent in pursuing a relationship with JP, similar to how he had relentlessly pursued others. Despite JP's repeated efforts to repel Sorenson, Sorenson began stalking JP after school. This persistence resulted in a kind of forced relationship JP could not seem to escape. Sorenson was careful to avoid ever coming into contact with JP’s parents or other authority figures when he was with JP or JP’s friends. Whenever JP’s parents were planning to drop him off at the movies or at the mall, Sorenson avoided being seen.</p>

          <p>As Sorenson began to latch onto JP, he was eventually able to bring his negative influence to bear. He used his greater age and stature, and his intimidating persona to play on the impressionability of JP, who was now just 17. Sorenson encouraged JP and other kids to do drugs with him and tried to coerce JP into helping him commit robberies. Fortunately, JP never aided Sorenson in any of these robberies, which included Sorenson’s plan to rob intoxicated people coming out of bars in Grand Haven and to target other vulnerable people he had “marked.”</p>

          <p>JP started to become increasingly wary of Sorenson’s behavior and the things Sorenson would say, such as talking about raping young girls and killing anyone who crossed him. He claimed he had murdered a black man whose house he burned down, among other things. Sorenson showed JP his guns and bragged about the crimes he had committed and his affiliation with several gangs.</p>

          <p>Sorenson’s increasingly menacing behavior caused JP to become reluctant to be around him and JP tried even harder to avoid him. However, Sorenson was persistent. On several occasions, Sorenson parked his truck along JP’s route home from school and waited to follow JP to a place where he could approach him. One such place included JP's grandfather's home, the same location where Sorenson would later die carrying out his failed extortion plot.</p>

          <p>When JP finally became insistent that Sorenson leave him alone, Sorenson became irate. Just as Sorenson told one of the PPO complainants who had tried to escape him, Sorenson threatened to kill JP, his family, his grandfather, and JP’s girlfriend. JP had no reason to doubt these threats, but did not know what to do. It was not long after this that Sorenson learned that one of JP’s high school friends had recently inherited $3,000.</p>

          <p>Knowing that JP’s friend had inherited this money, Sorenson’s plan to rob JP’s friend began to materialize. The plan consisted of having JP invite his friend to JP's grandfather's house. Once there, Sorenson would wait until JP’s friend entered the garage, whereupon Sorenson planned to hold his gun to his head and threaten to kill him unless he turned over his inheritance money. The garage was staged with a tarp and blow torch to intimidate the friend into complying. At trial, the prosecution’s own witness testified that if JP’s friend didn't comply, “Sorenson was going to shove a plunger up his ass.”</p>

          <p>On Tuesday, November 6, 2007, the first day the plan was to be carried out, JP was unable to get his friend to come over. Upon being informed of this, Sorenson immediately became enraged and threatened JP and JP’s co-defendant. Sorenson instructed JP that the plan would be carried out the following day, Wednesday, November 7th. When that day came, Sorenson arrived at the house as planned, carrying his gun and dressed as a “hit man” in an all black suit in preparation of carrying out the extortion plot. Sorenson, along with JP and JP’s co-defendant entered the garage to discuss the plan.</p>

          <p>Once satisfied with the arrangements, Sorenson instructed JP to once again call his friend over to the house. During the call, JP got cold feet and decided that he did not want to go through with helping Sorenson rob his friend. As soon as Sorenson realized JP was not going to follow through, he became enraged by the insubordination and pointed his gun at JP and the co-defendant, threatening to kill them. JP grabbed a household paring knife sitting amongst other clutter on his grandfather’s tool bench and, after a struggle, stabbed Sorenson to death. The time was approximately 4:00 PM in the afternoon and JP's grandfather was still inside the house along with the family dog, Pal.</p>

          <p>The events that just took place quickly led to panic, and JP and his co-defendant attempted to hide the identity of Sorenson's remains. There is no question that Sorenson's body was severely mutilated in the process, which provoked sensational media coverage when the prosecutor’s office carelessly labeled Sorenson’s death a “Thrill Kill.” And, while the details of the story are gruesome, the events leading up to what happened provide context to why JP would have been legitimately fearful of retaliation by the deceased’s cohorts.</p>

          <p>It is necessary to explain this story publicly because, despite access to much of the information referenced herein, no attention has ever been given to any of the facts leading up to Sorenson's death. No mention was ever made of the fact that Sorenson was a dangerous man who inspired real fear in the individuals he preyed on. Unfortunately, the original trial judge who heard the case (who was since removed for bias), did not allow the admission of evidence regarding Sorenson’s violent nature, among other information relevant to the story.</p>

          <p>When a complete version of the facts is reviewed, it is apparent that Sorenson’s death was not the result of a “Thrill Kill,” but rather an event created by his own doing. That is to say, Sorenson was not “lured” to his death, but came to JP’s grandfather’s home deliberately for a second time expecting to extort money from a high-schooler at gunpoint. Unfortunately, this story was not the narrative allowed to be told in court or the version published by the press.</p>

          <p>While there is substantially more information and numerous other factors that undoubtedly affected the outcome of the case, it is our sincerest hope that this information helps answer many of the questions people have concerning JP Orlewicz and the death of Daniel Vincent Sorenson.</p>
