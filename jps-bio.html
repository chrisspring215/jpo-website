          <p>Jean Pierre “JP” Orlewicz was born in 1990 and grew up in Plymouth, Michigan with his mother, father, and brother. As a boy, JP was known by all as a thoughtful, kind and generous person. Up and until JP met Daniel Sorenson, JP lived a fairly typical teenage life. He enjoyed spending time with his friends and family, and was especially close to his grandparents, whom he helped care when his grandmother developed Alzheimer’s disease. JP enjoyed going up north, playing with Pal, his grandparent's dog, working at his father's manufacturing company, and going to the movies. Everyone liked JP; he was respectful and exceptionally big-hearted, and was always willing to lend a hand. By all accounts JP was known as a good kid who had never ever been in trouble.</p>

          <p>Despite being incarcerated since he was 17, JP has retained his positive core characteristics and remains hopeful that he will one day be able to resume a normal life. Before being arrested for the events that led to the death of Daniel Sorenson, JP had never been in any trouble. His clean prior record is reflective of his character and is exemplified by his good behavior since being incarcerated. Despite being placed into an adult institution, JP has adapted to serving life in prison as well as could ever be expected for someone his age. His ability to stay positive and hopeful despite his circumstances continues to impress those close to him.</p>

          <p>Spiritually, JP leans on his faith to deal with the day-to-day stresses and challenges of prison life. He received the sacrament of Confirmation in the Catholic Church and continues to participate in the prison’s religious services. JP has also focused on bettering himself personally and academically. Since being incarcerated, he has earned his high school diploma, graduating as valedictorian. He completed state-sponsored programs for Real Estate Administration and for a Commercial Drivers License (CDL). JP has also finished a number of college courses he takes through correspondence toward a degree in Business. JP has worked hard to keep both his body and mind healthy despite the severe limitations of his environment.</p>
          
          <p>With the help and support of his family, JP continues to fight for himself and his release. In just 7 years, JP has been transferred from a maximum security, Level 4 prison, to a lower security, Level 2 facility due to his good behavior. There is no doubt that JP's progress will continue on its natural course. But for a singular set of circumstances that resulted in tragedy and derailed JP's young life, JP was and is a good person worthy of release from prison.</p>
